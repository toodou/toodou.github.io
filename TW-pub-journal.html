State-of-the-art platforms and apps cannot timely and customized estimate exposure risk for air passengers. This study integrated time-varying flight schedules, connecting airports, and epidemic situations in airport catchment areas for estimating a traveler's exposure risk during the user-defined flight journey and applying to the timely exposure risk during air travel (TERAT) for a spatial decision support system (SDSS). We leveraged epidemic information and dynamic flight schedules to estimate personalized and timely exposure risk. Flight frequency and arrival time of all inbound flights within 6 h before and after the current time were encompassed to determine the potentially infected passenger sources. We estimated the timely airport exposure risk for the user's destination airport and its top 10 importation risk origin airports and demonstrated the top 10 risk final destination airports from the user's destination airport. Two real-world scenarios showed that direct flight and transfer air passengers were exposed to time-varying risks at different travel stages; additionally, all high-risk exposure routes were highlighted. To our knowledge, TERAT is the first attempt to leverage real-world dynamic epidemiological data and flight schedules to estimate time-varying exposure risk for user-defined routes. We further converted airport exposure risk into four levels for determining the personal protection measures to facilitate the usage of exposure risk applications. Therefore, air passengers can protect themselves when facing passengers from high-risk areas in advance.</p>

Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of religions enhances our knowledge of both religious expansion and religious cultures. This paper aims to leverage spatiotemporal analysis to characterise the topology of the spread of multiple religions in the Taipei metropolitan area from 1660 to 2020, including Folk Taoism (853 temples/altars, 55.39%), Christianity (306 churches, 19.87%) and Buddhism (332 temples, 21.56%). Three major factors affecting religious distribution are considered: the year of establishment of religious units (churches, temples or altars), the reclamation year of religious locations, and the economic index of religious sites. The results show that Folk Taoism and Buddhism have a long history of development in early reclamation regions with a hopping expansion pattern. However, Christianity expanded later in the later reclaimed and early reclaimed areas. The Christian religious units have highly concentrated spatial patterns and are located in the higher-income districts, centralised in the core regions of the Taipei metropolis. Modern forms of highly institutionalised religion, such as Buddhism and Christianity, are more prevalent in the relatively higher-income, later-cultivated areas, which provide richer social resources for development. Folk Taoism, as a traditional religion, is maintained and developed by local communities. This macroscopic analysis helps to (1) identify the exact chronology of different growth waves and explain them in a historical context, and (2) elucidate the spatial distribution differences between institutionalised religions and folk religion. Our research shows the evolution of religious landscapes from an undeveloped city to a developed city, offering valuable insights for geographical and religious studies, and enhancing understanding of diffused and institutionalised religious expansion.</p>

The secondary outcomes included end-tidal co2 (Etco2) during CPR, any ROSC, survival to ICU and hospital discharge, post-resuscitation withdrawal, and favorable neurologic outcomes at discharge. Additional analyses on intra-arrest arterial blood pressure (ABP) were also conducted. The sample size was pre-estimated at 37 patients/group. From October 2020 to January 2023, 76 patients were enrolled, 39 and 37 in the AV uncompressed and AV compressed groups, respectively. Intergroup baseline characteristics were similar. Compared with the AV compressed group, the AV uncompressed group had a higher probability of sustained ROSC (53.8% vs. 24.3%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.72; p = 0.010), any ROSC (56.4% vs. 32.4%; aOR, 3.30; p = 0.033), and survival to ICU (33.3% vs. 8.1%; aOR, 6.74; p = 0.010), and recorded higher initial diastolic ABP (33.4 vs. 11.5 mm Hg; p = 0.002) and a larger proportion achieving diastolic ABP greater than 20 mm Hg during CPR (93.8% vs. 33.3%; p < 0.001). The Etco2, post-resuscitation withdrawal, and survival to discharge revealed no significant intergroup differences. No patients were discharged with favorable neurologic outcomes. Uncompressed AV seemed critical for sustained ROSC across all subgroups.</p>

Each wave was caused by a variant and presented different peaks and baselines. This made the identification of waves with the time series of the cases a difficult task. Human activity intensities may affect the occurrence of an outbreak. We demonstrated a metric of time series, namely log-moving-average-ratio (LMAR), to identify the waves and directions of the changes in the disease cases and check-ins (MySejahtera). Based on the detected waves and changes, we explore the relationship between the two. Using the stimulus-organism-response model with our results, we presented a four-stage model: (1) government-imposed movement restrictions, (2) revenge travel, (3) self-imposed movement reduction, and (4) the new normal. The inverse patterns between check-ins and pandemic waves suggested that the self-imposed movement reduction would naturally happen and would be sufficient for a smaller epidemic wave. People may spontaneously be aware of the severity of epidemic situations and take appropriate disease prevention measures to reduce the risks of exposure and infection. In summary, LMAR is more sensitive to the waves and could be adopted to characterize the association between travel willingness and confirmed disease cases. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: Malaysia; COVID-19; human activities; travel restriction; travel willingness; time series</p>

The study aims to assess the changes in intercity railway passenger transport on the early spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Examining the role of railway transport properties in disease transmission could help quantify the spatial spillover effects of large-scale travel restriction interventions. This study used daily high-speed railway schedule data to compare the differences in city-level network properties (destination arrival and transfer service) before and after the Wuhan city lockdown in the early stages of the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Bayesian multivariate regression was used to examine the association between structural changes in the railway origin-destination network and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the provinces with rising transfer activities after the Wuhan city lockdown had more confirmed COVID-19 cases, but changes in destination arrival did not have significant effects. The regions with increasing transfer activities were located in provinces neighboring Hubei in the widthwise and longitudinal directions. These results indicate that transfer activities enhance interpersonal transmission probability and could be a crucial risk factor for increasing epidemic severity after the Wuhan city lockdown. The destinations of railway passengers might not be affected by the Wuhan city lockdown, but their itinerary routes could be changed due to the replacement of an important transfer hub (Wuhan city) in the Chinese railway transportation network. As a result, transfer services in the high-speed rail network could explain why the provinces surrounded by Hubei had a higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than other provinces. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: transfer service; COVID-19; Wuhan city lockdown; high-speed rail network; intercity population flow; spatial transmission</p>

High- and low-temperature ultrasonication did not increase the degree of gelatinization, but generated cracks and pores on the starch granule surface and enhanced the short-range ordered molecular structure and apparent amylose content (AAC). Compared with incubation treatments, high-temperature ultrasonication gradually increased the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS), whereas low-temperature ultrasonication only decreased RS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate linear regression results showed that SDS and RS were significantly affected by the long-range ordered molecular structure, a molecular weight distribution of amylopectin, enthalpy change and AAC, whereas the short-range ordered molecular structure further dominated RS. Our results improved the understanding of physicochemical property changes in low- and high-temperature ultrasonication on semigelatinized high amylose maize starch and differentiated the significant principal components of SDS and RS formation. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: ultrasonication; <i>in vitro</i> digestibility; semigelatinization; high amylose maize starch</p>

Hence, airports’ connectivity plays an essential role in understanding the linkage between different markets, especially the impact of neighboring airports on focal airports. An airline alliance airport network (AAAN) comprises airports as nodes and routes as edges. It could reflect a clear collaborative proportion within AAAN and competitive routes between AAANs. Recent studies adopted an airport- or route-centric perspective to evaluate the relationship between airline alliances and their member airlines; meanwhile, they mentioned that an airport community could provide valuable air transportation information because it considers the entire network structure, including the impacts of the direct and indirect routes. The objectives are to identify spatial patterns of market region in an airline alliance and characterize the differences among airline alliances (Oneworld, Star Alliance, and SkyTeam), including regions of collaboration, competition, and dominance. Our results show that Star Alliance has the highest collaboration and international market dominance among three airline alliances. The most competitive regions are Asia-Pacific, West Asia, Europe, and North and Central America. The network approach we proposed identifies market characteristics, highlights the region of market advantages in the airline alliance, and also provides more insights for airline and airline alliances to extend their market share or service areas. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: airline alliance airport network; airport community; market characteristics</p>

To help prevent damage by debris flows, it is necessary to establish a new critical rainfall line for each debris flow stream. Following the Chi-Chi huge earthquake, the critical rainfall line of several debris flow streams in Taiwan was ostensibly reduced. To comprehend these changes, this study used a four-year (1999–2003) dataset of 79 debris flow events, and it adopted the family competition genetic algorithm as a clustering method to merge rainfall data of streams based on similar characteristics. In addition, 8 predisposing factors for debris flows were used to cluster 377 streams with similar predisposing factors into 7 groups via the genetic algorithm. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to establish the critical rainfall lines for debris flows. Experimental results confirmed that the SVM method performed well in setting a new critical rainfall line for each group of debris flow streams. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: cluster analysis; support vector machine; debris flow; critical rainfall line; earthquake</p>
