The study aims to assess the changes in intercity railway passenger transport on the early spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Examining the role of railway transport properties in disease transmission could help quantify the spatial spillover effects of large-scale travel restriction interventions. This study used daily high-speed railway schedule data to compare the differences in city-level network properties (destination arrival and transfer service) before and after the Wuhan city lockdown in the early stages of the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. Bayesian multivariate regression was used to examine the association between structural changes in the railway origin-destination network and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. Our results show that the provinces with rising transfer activities after the Wuhan city lockdown had more confirmed COVID-19 cases, but changes in destination arrival did not have significant effects. The regions with increasing transfer activities were located in provinces neighboring Hubei in the widthwise and longitudinal directions. These results indicate that transfer activities enhance interpersonal transmission probability and could be a crucial risk factor for increasing epidemic severity after the Wuhan city lockdown. The destinations of railway passengers might not be affected by the Wuhan city lockdown, but their itinerary routes could be changed due to the replacement of an important transfer hub (Wuhan city) in the Chinese railway transportation network. As a result, transfer services in the high-speed rail network could explain why the provinces surrounded by Hubei had a higher number of confirmed COVID-19 cases than other provinces. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: transfer service; COVID-19; Wuhan city lockdown; high-speed rail network; intercity population flow; spatial transmission</p>

High- and low-temperature ultrasonication did not increase the degree of gelatinization, but generated cracks and pores on the starch granule surface and enhanced the short-range ordered molecular structure and apparent amylose content (AAC). Compared with incubation treatments, high-temperature ultrasonication gradually increased the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS), whereas low-temperature ultrasonication only decreased RS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate linear regression results showed that SDS and RS were significantly affected by the long-range ordered molecular structure, a molecular weight distribution of amylopectin, enthalpy change and AAC, whereas the short-range ordered molecular structure further dominated RS. Our results improved the understanding of physicochemical property changes in low- and high-temperature ultrasonication on semigelatinized high amylose maize starch and differentiated the significant principal components of SDS and RS formation. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: ultrasonication; <i>in vitro</i> digestibility; semigelatinization; high amylose maize starch</p>

Due to the specific historical background of some Mazu temples in Yunlin and Chiayi, where many people from the agricultural area migrated to the metropolitan area during the period of industrialization in 1980s, the two counties have become the major destination areas for the Mazu-pilgrimage, with even more pilgrimage visitors than older areas like Tainan and Kaohsiung. Yet, no quantitative investigations have been conducted on the Mazu-pilgrimage in Taiwan. This study performs such a quantitative research, establish networks of pilgrim groups visiting more than one target temple from data collected from all Mazu-temples in Yunlin and Chiayi for three consecutive years. Using network analysis methods, including community detection and hierarchical clustering analysis, this study explores the characteristics of network structures with reference to different temporal and spatial conditions. The concept of a “co-constructed pilgrimage circle” is proposed as the basic structure for explaining the changes in network structure under different time and space conditions. This novel concept is expected to join the theories of worshipping circles and belief circles in related studies in enriching academic imagination of the modern development of Taiwanese popular religion. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: pilgrimage; co-constructed pilgrimage group; network analysis; community detection; Mazu</p>

Hence, airports’ connectivity plays an essential role in understanding the linkage between different markets, especially the impact of neighboring airports on focal airports. An airline alliance airport network (AAAN) comprises airports as nodes and routes as edges. It could reflect a clear collaborative proportion within AAAN and competitive routes between AAANs. Recent studies adopted an airport- or route-centric perspective to evaluate the relationship between airline alliances and their member airlines; meanwhile, they mentioned that an airport community could provide valuable air transportation information because it considers the entire network structure, including the impacts of the direct and indirect routes. The objectives are to identify spatial patterns of market region in an airline alliance and characterize the differences among airline alliances (Oneworld, Star Alliance, and SkyTeam), including regions of collaboration, competition, and dominance. Our results show that Star Alliance has the highest collaboration and international market dominance among three airline alliances. The most competitive regions are Asia-Pacific, West Asia, Europe, and North and Central America. The network approach we proposed identifies market characteristics, highlights the region of market advantages in the airline alliance, and also provides more insights for airline and airline alliances to extend their market share or service areas. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: airline alliance airport network; airport community; market characteristics</p>

To help prevent damage by debris flows, it is necessary to establish a new critical rainfall line for each debris flow stream. Following the Chi-Chi huge earthquake, the critical rainfall line of several debris flow streams in Taiwan was ostensibly reduced. To comprehend these changes, this study used a four-year (1999–2003) dataset of 79 debris flow events, and it adopted the family competition genetic algorithm as a clustering method to merge rainfall data of streams based on similar characteristics. In addition, 8 predisposing factors for debris flows were used to cluster 377 streams with similar predisposing factors into 7 groups via the genetic algorithm. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to establish the critical rainfall lines for debris flows. Experimental results confirmed that the SVM method performed well in setting a new critical rainfall line for each group of debris flow streams. <br /> <b>Keywords</b>: cluster analysis; support vector machine; debris flow; critical rainfall line; earthquake</p>
